### Basic Symbols used in Flowchart Designs
- **Terminal**: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart.
- **Input/Output**: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart.
- **Processing**: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol.
- **Decision**: Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart.
- **Flow lines**: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart. 

### Rules For Creating Flowchart 

A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm.it should follow some rules while creating a flowchart

- Rule 1: Flowchart opening statement must be ‘start’ keyword.
- Rule 2:  Flowchart ending statement must be ‘end’ keyword.
- Rule 3: All symbols in the flowchart must be connected with an arrow line.
- Rule 4: The decision symbol in the flowchart is associated with the arrow line.

 

### Advantages of Flowchart

- Flowcharts are a better way of communicating the logic of the system.
- Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.
- Flowcharts help in debugging process.
- With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.
- It provides better documentation.
- Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.
- Easy to trace errors in the software.
- Easy to understand.
- The flowchart can be reused for inconvenience in the future.
- It helps to provide correct logic.
 
### Disadvantages of Flowchart

- It is difficult to draw flowcharts for large and complex programs.
- There is no standard to determine the amount of detail.
- Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.
- It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.
- Making a flowchart is costly.
- Some developer thinks that it is waste of time.
- It makes software processes low.
- If changes are done in software, then the flowchart must be redrawn
