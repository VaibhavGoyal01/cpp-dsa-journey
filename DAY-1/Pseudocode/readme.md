# Pseudo-Code
It is a way of **expressing** an **algorithm** that involves usage of **plain** language to describe the steps of an algorithm.
- Start / Terminate
- Variable Assignment
- Input / Output
- Conditional Logic
- Loop

## What is the need for Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an important part of designing an algorithm, it helps the programmer in planning the solution to the problem as well as the reader in understanding the approach to the problem. Pseudocode is an intermediate state between algorithm and program that plays supports the transition of the algorithm into the program.


## How to write Pseudocode?
- Before writing the pseudocode of any algorithm the following points must be kept in mind. 
- Organize the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.
- At first, establishes the main goal or the aim.
Example:

```This program will print first N numbers of Fibonacci series.```

- Use standard programming structures such as if-else, for, while, and cases the way we use them in programming. Indent the statements if-else, for, while loops as they are indented in a program, it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. It also improves readability to a great extent.

**Example**:
```
IF “1”
   print response
       “I AM CASE 1”

IF “2”
   print response
       “I AM CASE 2”
```

- Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach of following what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will be the same as per that, so the naming must be simple and distinct.
- Reserved commands or keywords must be represented in capital letters.
Example: if you are writing IF…ELSE statements then make sure IF and ELSE be in capital letters.

- Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code are complete, finite, and clear to understand and comprehend. Also, explain everything that is going to happen in the actual code.
- Don’t write the pseudocode in a programming language. It is necessary that the pseudocode is simple and easy to understand even for a layman or client, minimizing the use of technical terms.
